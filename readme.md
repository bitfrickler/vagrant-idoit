# vagrant-idoit

## This is a vagrant configuration I use for working with i-doit (especially with its JSON-based API).

Dumps of idoit_data and idoit_system have to be put into the idoit folder before provisioning the machine.
You have to download i-doit and the API module by yourself and put them into the directory as well.
